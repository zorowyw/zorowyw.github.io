Yang-wen Wu, Associate Professor and Master's Supervisor. From 2012 to 2022, he pursued his doctoral studies at North China Electric Power University, earning a Ph.D. in Renewable Energy and Clean Energy. From 2022 to 2024, he conducted postdoctoral research at the Postdoctoral Research Station for Power Engineering and Engineering Thermophysics at North China Electric Power University. In 2025, he was appointed Associate Professor and Master's Supervisor. He has led projects including the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Youth Fund, the Postdoctoral Innovation Talent Support Program, the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation General Funding, and Central University Basic Operational Funds. To date, he has published over 60 papers in internationally authoritative journals in his field (including more than 30 SCI papers as first or corresponding author) and holds over 10 authorized invention patents. Awards include the First Prize of Hubei Provincial Science and Technology Progress Award, First Prize of the Innovation Award at the China Invention Association's Invention Entrepreneurship Awards, and the Gold Medal at the Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions. Since commencing work in 2022, has co-supervised multiple graduate students who have received the First Prize in the National College Students' Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Social Practice and Technology Competition, the Beijing First Prize in the China International College Students Innovation Competition, one President's Scholarship, four National Scholarships, three North China Electric Power University Outstanding Thesis Awards, and four Beijing Outstanding Graduate Awards.
